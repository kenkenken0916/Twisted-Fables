## 2025-06-11: Character Selection System Fix

### Issues Fixed:
1. Character Selection System Bug
   - Problem: Character 1 (Little Red Riding Hood) couldn't be selected
   - Root Cause: Code was using 0 both as Little Red Riding Hood's ID and as "no character selected" state
   - Files Affected:
     - game_logic.c
     - game_init.c
     - game_state.c

### Changes Made:

1. Changed Character Selection State Tracking
   ```c
   // Changed from using 0 to using UINT8_MAX for "no character selected"
   p->character = UINT8_MAX;  // in game_init.c
   ```

2. Fixed Character Selection Validation
   ```c
   // Old code (problematic)
   if (gs->players[gs->now_turn_player_id].character != 0) {
       return;
   }

   // New code
   if (gs->players[gs->now_turn_player_id].character != UINT8_MAX) {
       return;
   }
   ```

3. Fixed Game End Check Logic
   - Modified game end check to ensure both players must select characters
   - Added proper validation to prevent premature game end
   - Updated state transition logic for character selection phase

### Current State:
1. Character Selection:
   - Both players can now select any character including Little Red Riding Hood (ID 0)
   - Proper turn switching between players during character selection
   - Character stats and initialization working correctly

2. Game State Transitions:
   - Character selection → Player 2's turn → Main game phase
   - Initial hand dealt correctly after both players select characters

3. Known Working Features:
   - Character selection for both players
   - Initial game setup
   - Basic turn structure
   - Hand card display
   - Action selection menu

### TODO:
1. Test and verify combat system
2. Implement card buying system
3. Complete special abilities for each character
4. Add victory condition checks
5. Implement card combination system
6. Add proper game end handling

### Tests Performed:
1. Character Selection Test
   - Selected Little Red Riding Hood (Player 1)
   - Selected Snow White (Player 2)
   - Verified correct stats and initial hands

2. Basic Gameplay Test
   - Verified turn system
   - Checked action menu display
   - Confirmed hand card display

### Notes:
- The fix for character selection required changing the "no character selected" state from 0 to UINT8_MAX throughout the codebase
- State transitions are now properly handling character selection phase
- Initial game setup is working as intended

### Next Steps:
1. Complete combat system implementation
2. Add card buying functionality
3. Implement character special abilities
4. Add proper game end conditions
5. Implement full turn cycle logic
